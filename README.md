# wilson.js

Wrapper for the Wilson Score Equation to calculate rank based on positive and negative votes. (Lower bound of Wilson score confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter)

The goal with wilson.js was to provide reusable code for both the client and server using javascript.

## Usage

Include file:
<pre>
&lt;script src='wilson.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

The wilson object is now bound to the parent scope. Most of the time this will be _window.wilson_

### Methods
* **getScore()**
* **getSorted()**

```javascript
