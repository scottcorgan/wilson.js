Most of the time this will be ` window.wilson `\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar scored,\r\n    obj = {\r\n      name : 'Product 1',\r\n      positive : 1337,\r\n      negative : 123\r\n    };\r\n\r\nscored = wilson.score(obj);\r\n\r\n/*\r\n    Output:\r\n    \r\n    {\r\n        name : 'Product 1',\r\n        positive : 1337,\r\n        negative : 123,\r\n        score: 0.9003915795238371  // this is the score\r\n    }\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### score([obj, array])\r\nGet the Wilson Score of an object or an array. Returns that object or array with score added.\r\n### sort(array)\r\nSort an array based on it's Wilson Score. If objects in array don't already have the score, it will be calculated and added.\r\n","tagline":"Wrapper for the Wilson Score Equation to calculate rank based on positive and negative impressions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
